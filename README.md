w1-gpio-cl
==========

This is a Linux kernel-mode driver, intended as an enhancement/substitution
of the standard Linux `w1-gpio` 1-wire bus master driver. Contrary to
the standard driver, `w1-gpio-cl` is not a platform device driver, therefore
doesn't need any specific device-tree overlay nor preconfigured kernel (except
usual 1-wire support via the `wire` module). Moreover, there is possible
coexistence between `w1-gpio` and `w1-gpio-cl`, provided no GPIO conflicts
exist.

Module configuration
--------------------

`w1-gpio-cl` is fully configured via its command line parameters while loading
the driver. The configuration allows to launch many 1-wire bus masters
controlling different GPIO pins. For parasite powering support, it is
possible to choose a type of the strong pull-up to be used.

General configuration syntax is:

    modprobe w1-gpio-cl m1="gdt:num[,od][,bpu|gpu:num[,rev]]" [m2="..." ...]

NOTE: `:` and `,` syntax tokens may be replaced by `=` and `;` respectively,
so `m1="gdt:4,od"` is equivalent to `m1="gdt:4;od"`, `m1="gdt=4,od"` or
`m1="gdt=4;od"`.

`m1`, `m2`, ... `mN` - configure up to N (where N=5 for the standard module
compilation) bus masters, each one controlling different 1-wire bus connected
to its GPIO pin (specified in `gdt`). At least one bus master specification
(that is `m1`) must be provided. It's worth to note, the `X` index in `mX`
parameter specifies an order in which bus masters are registered in the 1-wire
subsystem. The index doesn't need to correspond to the bus master id assigned
by the kernel.

Each of bus master configurations consist of set of parameters listed below:

* `gdt` - specifies GPIO number associated with the 1-wire data wire (the
  1-wire bus). This parameter is obligatory for each bus master specification.

* `od` - if specified, the data wire GPIO (`gdt`) is of an open drain type.

* `bpu` - if specified, parasite powering is enabled via the data wire strong
  pull-up bit-banging. This type of strong pull-up is possible only for non
  open-drain type of the data wire GPIO (`gdt`).

* `gpu` - specifies GPIO number used for controlling strong pull-up for
  parasite powering. The GPIO is working in the output mode and is set to the
  low state if the strong pull-up is active, and to the high state otherwise.

  The strong pull-up controlled by the `gpu` GPIO is the only possibility for
  an open-drain type of the data wire GPIO (`gdt`). In this case the `gpu` GPIO
  may be connected to a P-channel MOSFET gate controlling the `Vcc` strong
  pull-up as presented on the following figure.

  NOTE: In place of the MOSFET there is possible to use a PNP bipolar transistor
  with its emitter connected to `Vcc`, collector to the data wire and base to
  the controlling GPIO (`gpu`). If needed base-collector current reducing resistor
  shall be placed between the transistor's base and `gpu` pin.

* `rev` - if specified and the `gpu` parameter is provided, the `gpu` GPIO
  logic is reversed for the strong pull-up activation: GPIO in the high state
  if the strong pull-up is active, low state - otherwise.

Example of usage
----------------

![Example](schema/example.png)

In this example, there have been configured three bus masters:

* 1st one on GPIO1 controlling non-parasitically powered thermometers.

* 2nd one on GPIO2 controlling parasitically powered thermometers. Strong
  pull-up is performed via the data wire bit-banging (non open-drain data GPIO).

* 3nd one devoted to handle iButton reader(s) only. Using separate 1-wire bus
  in this case is justified by the performance reason. The iButton bus is empty
  for most of its time, and is scanned/searched much more often than other
  buses for presence of authorized iButtons existence.

NOTE: GPIO1, GPIO2, GPIO3 are numbers specifying actual GPIO pins.

Compilation and loading
-----------------------

**Prerequisites**

* Standard Linux kernel building toolset: `gcc`, GNU Make, `bc` etc.
  For Debian family systems required packages may be installed by:

      sudo apt-get install build-essential bc

* Kernel headers and `kbuild` scripts corresponding to the target kernel.

  Provided you are compiling the module for the host machine the required
  headers may be installed by (Debian family OSes):

      sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`

  There is also possible to indicate a target kernel source tree by setting
  `KERNEL_SRC` as the source tree directory for the project `Makefile` (see
  below). The source tree need to be prepared via proper configuration and
  `modules_prepare` as follows (launched from the kernel source tree directory):

      make CONFIG_TARGET
      make modules_prepare

  where *CONFIG_TARGET* is a specific configuration target (e.g. for Raspberry
  Pi boards the configuration shall be set to `bcmrpi_defconfig`, `bcm2709_defconfig`
  or `bcm2711_defconfig` depending on the platform version).

  This approach is especially useful for the module cross-compilation, in which
  case there is also a need to set `ARCH` and `CROSS_COMPILE` to their proper
  values. Good explanation of kernel cross-compilation (for Raspberry Pi boards)
  is [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/kernel/building.md).

**Compilation**

General compilation command syntax is as follows (launched from the project
directory):

    [KERNEL_SRC=...] [ARCH=...] [CROSS_COMPILE=...] [CONFIG_W1_MAST_MAX=...] make

The result is `w1-gpio-cl.ko` driver module located in the project directory.
All compilation definitions (`KERNEL_SRC`, `ARCH`, ...) are optional, with the
following meaning:

* `KERNEL_SRC`: specifies kernel source tree directory (see above).

* `ARCH`, `CROSS_COMPILE`: are used for module cross-compilation exactly as
  for the Linux kernel.

* `CONFIG_W1_MAST_MAX`: by default the module is compiled to support up to 5 bus
  masters. This may be changed by setting this definition.

**Installation**

If the module was compiled on the destination machine there is possible to
install it into the modules destination directory by:

    sudo make install

and uninstall by:

    sudo make uninstall

If the module was cross-compiled, copy `w1-gpio-cl.ko` module into its destination
location on the target machine (`/lib/modules/KERNEL_RELEASE/kernel/drivers/w1/masters`)
and remake the kernel modules dependencies by `depmod`.

**Loading**

    sudo modprobe w1-gpio-cl MODULE_CONFIG

where the *MODULE_CONFIG* part specifies 1-wire bus master(s) configuration as
described above.

If you need to load the module automatically update `/etc/modules` appropriately.
